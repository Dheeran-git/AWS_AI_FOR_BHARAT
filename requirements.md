# Requirements Document: Sarathi Welfare Platform

## Introduction

Sarathi is an AI-driven, proactive welfare intelligence platform designed to bridge the critical gap in India's public welfare delivery system. Despite 700+ government welfare schemes, the average eligible citizen benefits from only 2-3 schemes due to awareness failures, complexity, and systemic barriers. 

**Vision Statement**: "Sarathi is an AI-powered welfare intelligence platform that ensures the right benefit reaches the right citizen at the right time, even if the citizen cannot read, write, or use the internet."

**Hackathon Positioning**: "Sarathi is not a scheme finder — it is India's first AI-powered welfare delivery engine, designed for the poorest, the illiterate, and the invisible."

Sarathi addresses this through conversational AI (Amazon Lex), knowledge-graph eligibility engines (Amazon Neptune), life-event triggers, panchayat-assisted outreach, welfare digital twins, conflict-resolution optimization, zero-knowledge privacy proofs, offline-first mesh networking, and community validation to ensure no eligible citizen is left behind.

## Key Innovations

Sarathi introduces several novel features not present in any existing welfare platform:

### 1. Welfare Digital Twin (Predictive Simulation)
Instead of just checking current eligibility, Sarathi creates a simulated future profile for households, modeling their journey over 3-5 years. If a daughter turns 18 in two years, the system pre-emptively flags higher education scholarships today so families can prepare documents in advance. This transforms "eligibility checking" into "life-path planning."

**Hackathon Pitch**: "We don't just tell you what you qualify for today; we show you the roadmap to pull your family out of poverty over the next 5 years."

### 2. Conflict-Resolution Engine (Schemes as Code)
Many Indian schemes are mutually exclusive (if you take Benefit A, you're disqualified from Benefit B). Sarathi uses game theory and optimization algorithms to suggest the "Optimal Benefit Bundle" - calculating which combination provides the highest monetary/social value without triggering disqualification. This solves the "opportunity cost" problem where citizens pick a small benefit and accidentally block themselves from a larger one.

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Documentation (Privacy-Preserving Proof)
Sarathi integrates Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to solve the "Privacy vs. Eligibility" trade-off. Instead of Panchayat officials seeing actual bank balances or health records, Sarathi generates cryptographic "Yes/No" proofs that citizens meet thresholds. Officials can help with applications without ever seeing sensitive private data, reducing risk of local harassment or data misuse.

### 4. Offline-First Mesh Networking (Dark Zone Coverage)
For rural areas with zero internet connectivity, Sarathi implements P2P mesh networking where the app on a Panchayat official's phone collects data from citizens' basic phones via Bluetooth/Local Wi-Fi, stores locally, and auto-syncs to AWS cloud once reaching a 4G/5G zone. This ensures "Invisible Citizen" detection works even in the most remote tribal belts.

### 5. Benefit Portability Logic (Internal Migrant Tracking)
Using Amazon Location Service, Sarathi detects when users are in different states and automatically translates eligibility to "closest equivalent" schemes in host states (e.g., moving from state-specific health card to Ayushman Bharat). This solves the "Ghost Citizen" problem where people exist in records but cannot access benefits due to geographical displacement.

### 6. Community Validation & Success Loop
When citizens successfully receive benefits through Sarathi, they verify via simple missed call or voice note. This builds a "Heatmap of Delivery" showing which local offices are performing and which are stalling, creating a real-time "Governance Performance Index" that drives accountability.

## Expected Impact

### Social Impact
- **Inclusion**: Increase scheme coverage from 2-3 to 8-10 schemes per eligible citizen
- **Exclusion Reduction**: Reduce eligible non-beneficiaries by 70% within 2 years
- **Empowerment**: Enable illiterate citizens to access welfare independently through voice
- **Migrant Support**: Provide continuous welfare access for 60% of seasonal migrants
- **Invisible Citizens**: Identify and enroll 80% of zero-benefit households

### Administrative Impact
- **Fraud Reduction**: Decrease ineligible beneficiaries by 50% without increasing false positives
- **Efficiency**: Reduce application processing time by 50%
- **Transparency**: Create public governance performance index for all welfare offices
- **Policy Insights**: Provide data-driven recommendations for scheme improvements
- **Panchayat Empowerment**: Transform local governance with intelligence tools

### Economic Impact
- **Benefit Delivery**: Secure ₹125+ crore in benefits for previously excluded citizens
- **Leakage Reduction**: Save ₹200+ crore annually through fraud prevention
- **Poverty Reduction**: Enable measurable poverty exit pathways for vulnerable households
- **Administrative Savings**: Reduce manual eligibility checking costs by 60%

### Technological Impact

- **Privacy Innovation**: Showcase zero-knowledge proofs in government systems
- **Offline-First**: Prove mesh networking viability for rural digital inclusion
- **Scalability**: Handle 100M+ citizen profiles with sub-3-second response times

## Problem Statement

### Core Failures in Current System

1. **Awareness & Discovery Failure**: Citizens remain unaware of schemes they qualify for. Scheme information is scattered across multiple portals, written in bureaucratic English, and hard to understand even for educated users.
2. **Complexity Barrier**: Overlapping, conflicting, and mutually exclusive eligibility rules create confusion. Citizens often apply for wrong schemes, block larger benefits unknowingly, and get rejected without explanation.
3. **Literacy & Digital Divide**: Large illiterate/semi-literate population lacks digital access. Existing portals assume literacy, internet access, and digital confidence.
4. **Reactive Model**: No proactive identification of missed beneficiaries. Welfare delivery is application-driven; if citizens don't actively search and apply, they receive no benefits.
5. **Panchayat Intelligence Gap**: Manual eligibility assessment without automated support. Panchayats have birth/death records, household registers, and BPL lists but lack automated eligibility mapping and alerts.
6. **Misuse vs Exclusion Paradox**: Ineligible candidates exploit schemes while eligible are excluded. Current systems cannot detect misuse across schemes or prevent fraud without harassing the poor.
7. **Migrant Invisibility**: Seasonal migrants lose benefits when crossing state boundaries. Some households exist in records but receive zero benefits. No system detects the absence of welfare.

### Gaps in Existing Systems

Current platforms (National Portal of India, myScheme.gov.in, State portals, CSC systems) have critical limitations:
- No conversational guidance or voice-first interface
- No eligibility intelligence or automated matching

## Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Lakshmi - Illiterate Widow Discovering Benefits

**Background**: Lakshmi is a 45-year-old illiterate widow in rural Bihar. Her husband died 6 months ago. She has two school-age children and works as a daily wage laborer. She is unaware of widow pension, child education schemes, and food security programs she qualifies for.

**Sarathi Journey**:

1. **Proactive Outreach**: When her husband's death is registered, Sarathi's life-event engine identifies her as eligible for 8 schemes (widow pension, survivor benefits, child education, food security, housing, health insurance, skill training, employment guarantee)

2. **Panchayat Alert**: The Gram Panchayat Secretary receives an outreach alert showing Lakshmi's name, eligible schemes, and estimated total benefit value of ₹85,000/year

3. **Assisted Registration**: Field worker visits Lakshmi's home with a tablet. Using Sarathi's assisted mode, they:
   - Collect her information via voice in Bhojpuri dialect
   - Sarathi explains each scheme in simple language
   - System detects conflict: widow pension and employment guarantee are mutually exclusive
   - Conflict resolution engine recommends optimal bundle: widow pension + child education + food security + health insurance (total ₹72,000/year vs. ₹45,000 with employment guarantee)

4. **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Lakshmi's income is verified using ZKP - Panchayat official sees "Qualifies: Yes" without seeing her actual income, protecting her privacy

5. **Offline Operation**: Field worker's device works without internet, queues registration, syncs when back at Panchayat office

6. **Welfare Digital Twin**: System shows Lakshmi's 5-year pathway:
   - Year 1-2: Widow pension + child education
   - Year 3: Elder daughter turns 18, becomes eligible for higher education scholarship
   - Year 4: Skill training program for Lakshmi
   - Year 5: Potential small business loan eligibility

7. **Community Validation**: After 30 days, Lakshmi receives a missed call request. She confirms pension receipt. Her validation token contributes to the Panchayat's performance score.

**Outcome**: Lakshmi goes from 0 schemes to 4 schemes, receiving ₹72,000/year. She has a clear 5-year plan to improve her family's situation.

### Scenario 2: Ravi - Seasonal Migrant Worker

**Background**: Ravi is a construction worker from Odisha who migrates to Mumbai for 8 months every year. He loses access to his PDS ration card and health coverage when away from home. His children's education suffers due to migration.

**Sarathi Journey**:

1. **Migration Detection**: Sarathi's location service detects Ravi has moved from Odisha to Maharashtra

2. **Benefit Portability Analysis**: System identifies:
   - PDS ration card: Not portable, but Maharashtra has equivalent scheme
   - Health insurance (Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana): Can transfer to Ayushman Bharat
   - Child education support: Portable with documentation

3. **Automatic Transfer**: Sarathi initiates transfer requests to Maharashtra welfare system with Ravi's consent

4. **Migrant Dashboard**: Ravi sees his benefit status in both states:
   - Home State (Odisha): Paused during migration
   - Host State (Maharashtra): Active equivalent benefits
   - Transfer Status: Health insurance (completed), Ration card (pending documentation)

5. **Proactive Alerts**: System notifies Ravi:
   - "Your ration card transfer needs Aadhaar update - visit nearest CSC"
   - "Your son will be eligible for scholarship in 3 months - start collecting documents"

6. **Return Home**: When Ravi returns to Odisha after 8 months, Sarathi automatically restores his original benefits and cancels temporary Maharashtra benefits

**Outcome**: Ravi maintains welfare access during migration, doesn't lose benefits due to geographical displacement. His family receives continuous support.

### Scenario 4: Government Administrator - Fraud Detection & Policy Insights

**Background**: Dr. Sharma is a state welfare department administrator responsible for reducing leakage while ensuring no eligible citizen is excluded.

**Sarathi Journey**:

1. **Fraud Dashboard**: Dr. Sharma reviews fraud detection alerts:
   - 127 applications flagged for cross-scheme inconsistencies
   - 43 lifestyle-income anomalies detected
   - 18 duplicate benefit attempts across schemes

2. **Explainable AI Review**: For each flag, system provides:
   - Fraud score with contributing factors
   - Explainability report showing which data points triggered alert
   - Recommendation: Low risk (auto-approve), Medium risk (quick review), High risk (detailed investigation)

3. **Human-in-Loop Decision**: Dr. Sharma reviews medium-risk cases:
   - Applicant claims BPL status but owns smartphone and vehicle
   - System recommends verification but doesn't auto-reject
   - Dr. Sharma approves field verification
   - Investigation reveals vehicle is employer-provided, applicant is genuinely eligible
   - System learns from this case, adjusts algorithm to reduce false positives

4. **Policy Insights**: Sarathi's analytics dashboard shows:
   - Scheme X has 23% non-delivery rate in District Y (governance issue)
   - Scheme Z has high fraud rate (eligibility criteria need tightening)
   - 15,000 eligible citizens are unaware of new scheme launched 3 months ago
   - Migrant workers are underserved (only 12% enrolled vs. 67% eligible)

5. **Welfare Twin Forecasting**: System predicts:
   - 45,000 citizens will become eligible for pension schemes in next 2 years
   - Budget requirement: ₹340 crore for next fiscal year
   - High-impact intervention: Proactive outreach to 8,500 invisible citizens could secure ₹125 crore in benefits

6. **Success Loop Analysis**: Community validation data reveals:
   - District A: 92% delivery success (best practices identified)
   - District B: 54% delivery success (intervention needed)
   - Scheme P: 88% satisfaction, Scheme Q: 61% satisfaction (scheme design issue)

**Outcome**: Dr. Sharma reduces fraud by 47% while increasing coverage by 65%. False positive rate drops from 18% to 4%. Policy recommendations lead to scheme improvements. State becomes national model for ethical welfare delivery.
